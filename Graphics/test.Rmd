## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data <- read.table("/home/user/Sirius/gene_network_sirius_2019/Graphics/result.txt")

library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(pheatmap)

data.decasted = dcast(data, V1 ~ V2, value.var = "V3")

row_names = data.decasted[, 1]
col_names = c("100x10", "200x10", "200x10 bgr", "100x100", "200x100", "200x100 bgr", "100x50", "200x50", "200x50 bgr", "2000x10 bgr", "400x10 bgr", "400x20 bgr", "400x40 bgr", "800x10 bgr", "1000x10 bgr", "1000x50 bgr", "1200x10 bgr", "1400x10 bgr")

data.decasted.new = data.decasted[, 2:dim(data.decasted)[2]]

rownames(data.decasted.new) = row_names
colnames(data.decasted.new) = col_names

pheatmap(data.decasted.new,border_color = "black",fontsize_row = 15, fontsize_col=15)

library(RColorBrewer)
col=brewer.pal(8,"Greens")
pheatmap(data.decasted.new,border_color = "black",fontsize_row = 15, fontsize_col=15,color = colorRampPalette((brewer.pal(n = 7, 
	name = "Greens")))(100))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
